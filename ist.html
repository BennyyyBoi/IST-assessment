	<h2>Internet and Wesbite Development</h2>
	<h3>A Brief Introduction about the World Wide Web</h3>
	<p>The World Wide Web, also know as WWW, is a software platform where web browsers (applications in which it is used to visit and view websites) can access documents and other web resources. A web server is a software program that sets out these web pages to web browsers. The web works by then simply allowing access to a large number of documents that are linked together with the usage of hypertext or hypermedia links</p>
	<h3>Difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet</h3>
	<p>The pages you see when you're online on a device are known as the world wide web.Â  The internet, on the other hand, is the network of connected computers that the web runs on, as well as the route through which emails and data move.</p>
	<h3>Meaning of Intranet and its relation to the Internet</h3>
	<p>The intranet is a private network that is primarily used to safely share information and computing resources among employees within a company. The internet, on the other hand, is a globally-connected network. The intranet is similar to the internet as an IP address is required for communication on both the internet and intranet.</p>
	<h3>Definition of Internet Protocol</h3>
	<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is a collection of rules for arranging and addressing data packets so that they can transit across networks and reach their intended destination. Numerous other protocols are used to provide certain services. HTTP provides a protocol for requesting and retrieving Web Resources, which enables the hyperlink technique. Files can be moved from one platform to another in the FTP protocol. TCP is a network protocol that allows application applications and computing devices to communicate over a network.</p>
